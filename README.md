PUMA

- A NASA Prototype designed to sample real-time breath samples and predict hypoxia in pilots, divers, and first responders; and help physicians monitor chronic pulmonary disease. U.S. Patent Number: 11,129,546 | Tops Number: LEW-TOPS-16. 
- Created the operating system connecting the various sensors and implemented the mathematical algorithm calculating the volumetric flow rate of CO2 and O2 to show whether hypoxia will be reached.
- Implemented a user-interface system for easy visualization of the data coming from the sensors and implementing the patent's mathematical calculations.
