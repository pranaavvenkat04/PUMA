PUMA (Portable Unit for Metabolic Analysis) (NASA TOPS: LEW-TOPS-16 | US Patent: #11,129,546)
- Skills: Software Development · Raspberry Pi · Python · Electrical Design · Linux · Operating Systems


- A NASA Prototype designed to sample real-time breath samples and predict hypoxia in pilots, divers, and first responders; and help physicians monitor chronic pulmonary disease. 
- Created the operating system connecting the various sensors and implemented the mathematical algorithm calculating the volumetric flow rate of CO2 and O2 to show whether hypoxia will be reached.
- Implemented a user-interface system for easy visualization of the data coming from the sensors and implementing the patent's mathematical calculations.
